  Struct#members

Arbitrary Object diffing strategies?
  User-provided converter strategies?
  Default impl via "to_json" or somesuch?

HashStrategy and ArrayStrategy directly invoke Difference.diff as their recursion strategy
  Decouple? How?

Alternate Array-diffing strategies?
  Added/Removed strategy
