Arbitrary Object diffing strategies?
  User-provided converter strategies
  Default impl via "to_json" or somesuch?

Refactor code internals to define HashDiff and ArrayDiff as strategies

"Visitor" approach

Alternate Array-diffing strategies?
  Added/Removed strategy
  

Tests:
  Express HashDiffs and ArrayDiffs via inline expressions
